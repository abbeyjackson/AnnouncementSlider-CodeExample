# CodeExample-AnnouncementSlider
An announcement slider with a background image, two text labels, and page control indicator (navigation dots). 

Feel free to use as you please, no credit need be given.

In the screenshot the background is a colour but if you add images to the Announcement objects you create then they should become the background image. Please let me know if there are any problems so I can keep this up to date for people who need it.
